# cloud-file-uploader ☁️
CloudFileUploader is a mini bash-based CLI project that will allow you to upload your file to an Azure storage account and into a container. It will list the files that have been uploaded into the container. 

This project is inspired by madebygps from https://learntocloud.guide Capstone Project: CloudUploader CLI 😊
